## 🧩 Game Rules  

1. **Two players** take turns rolling the dice.  
2. On each roll:
   - If the player rolls a `1`:
     - 🎭 They lose their current round score.  
     - 🔄 It's the next player's turn.  
   - If the player rolls `2-6`:
     - ➕ The score is added to their current round score.
3. Players can **"Hold"** at any time to:
   - 🔐 Save their round score to their total score.
   - 🕹️ Pass the turn to the next player.
4. 🎉 The first player to reach **100 points** wins the game!
